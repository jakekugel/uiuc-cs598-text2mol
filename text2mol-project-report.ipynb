While many existing information retrieval systems for molecular databases rely solely on searching just the natural language descriptions, this approach has limitations because there are many molecules that have a known structure, but for which there has not been laboratory experimentation needed to create the natural language description.  For example, the PubChem database has 110 million chemical compounds of which many do not yet have a natural language description.\n","\n","Because of the lack of natural language descriptions for many molecules, natural language queries of molecular databases cannot retrieve many chemical compounds because there is no natural language description for them.  This slows progress in areas where discovery of new properties and applications of chemicals is important, such as medicine.\n","\n","In the paper, \"Text2Mol: Cross-Modal Molecule Retrieval with Natural Language Queries\" [1], the authors define a new task called Text2Mol which requires the use of a natural language query to retrieve molecules that have a known chemical structure but no natural language description.  In other words, queries in one modality (natural language) are used to retrieve information in another modality (chemical structure).  In this task, the chemical notation is considered a language in itself, which makes the task fall into the category of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).\n","\n","The authors develop a method to accomplish this task by constructing an aligned semantic embedding space for both the natural language embeddings and the chemical notation embeddings.  This means that the molecule's natural language description is mapped to an embedding, and its chemical structure is mapped to an embedding, and the mapping is done in such a way that the resulting embeddings are similar.  Once the aligned space is constructed, a query in either modality can be translated into an embedding in the aligned space and a similarity search used to locate other embeddings in either modality.\n","\n","For training of the models involved in the task, the authors build a new dataset that contains pairs of molecule descriptions and the corresponding chemical notations.  The dataset, called ChEBI-20, contains 33,010 pairs of molecule natural language descriptions and corresponding chemical notations.  The authors built their dataset from two existing datasets: PubChem (containing chemical notations of molecules), and ChEBI (containing natural language descriptions of molecules)."],"metadata":{"id":"RRto71KVNeva"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Scope of Reproducibility\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uygL9tTPSVHB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our project, documented by this notebook, will test several of the original hypotheses by the authors in the original pager [1].

And an effective method for CLIR in this situation is a shared aligned semantic embedding space.  We will create an aligned semantic embedding space and measure the MRR and Hits@1 performance measurements.\n","- Hypothesis 2: using an ensemble approach, where multiple embedding spaces are constructed using different methods and then combined is more effective than using a single method and a single embedding space.  We will create an embedding space using different methods, and compare the MRR and Hits@1 performance metrics of the combined space with a single embedding space.\n","\n","Additionally, we plan to extend the original study with the following ablation study:\n","\n","- Hypothesis 3: In the ensemble approach of hypthosis #2 above. increasing the number of MLP or GCN models will moderately increase the MRR of the ensemble approach.

In the GCNModel class defined below, the model architecture consists of 7 layers in total: 3 GCNConv layers and 4 Linear Layers each of variable size, two activation functions (ReLU and SELU) and two normalization functions (LayerNorm). The GCN convolutions used to obtain the node embeddings are conv1, conv2, and conv3 with the ReLU activation function run after conv1 and conv2. Then, global_mean_pool is run. Finally, mol_hidden1 and mol_hidden2 are run as hidden layers with the ReLU function after each before mol_hidden3 is run as a linear projection. Finally, ln1, is run as the layer normalization function. Similar to the MLPModel class, there is a Linear layer, text_hidden1, that is used for linear projection of text_x and a normalization function, ln2.

We first tried Colab (with the Colab Pro subscription), but the notebooks required multiple hours to run, and often experienced intermittent Colab disconnects and Google Drive timeouts.\n","\n","Second, we tried running the notebooks and scripts on our personal Macs/Windows PCs.  We experienced problems due to lack of GPUs, lack of enough memory, and the fact the original code appears to have been primarily tested on Linux. When running the provided code on a Mac, we ran into an issue of pickling. There are multiple reasons this could have been an issue, we hypothesize that it's due to the version of Python we are operating on. Pickling is suppose to be introduce in all current versions of Python, but according to various sources there has been reports of it being incompatible with version 3.5+.\n","\n","Third, we tried submitting a request for hardware from NCSA's Delta program.  The approval process required a professor to be listed as a principal investigator, and so I (Jake) dropped this request because it felt like I was overstepping by asking Prof. Sun to add his name as a PI.\n","\n","Finally, we used a GCP VM for running the experiments.  This worked, but it still had challenges.  There were times when we tried to start the VM, and it failed because there were no GPUs available in our GCP region.  Sometimes it took multiple days in order to start the VM again.\n","\n","In addition to the previous issues, the project requirements to show the functionality of the code within the given time constraint of 8 minutes proved difficult. We started with an attempt to pickle the class objects created in the data pre-processing step due to the significant amount of time it took (1 hour). We ran into multiple issues including google drive file transfer failures and timeouts. When, we succeeded in saving a pickle file of the class objects, there was an new error that we were not able to resolve further along in the code. When we switch to using gdown, the data pre-processing time was significantly reduced, due to the files being stored locally in Colab's VM.
